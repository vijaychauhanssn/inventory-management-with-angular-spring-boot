### Installation (on Ubuntu)

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose (Refer https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/mihiran-paranamana/inventory-management-angular-spring-boot.git`).
3. Move into the _inventory-management-angular-spring-boot_ root folder (`cd inventory-management-angular-spring-boot`).
4. Run build script (`sudo bash ./build.sh`).
5. Run the installation script (`sudo bash ./install.sh`).
6. Browse http://localhost:4200/

* With the 4th step, It will create builds for the angular client app (inside _inventory-management-angular-spring-boot/client/dist/client/_) as well as the spring boot server app (inside _inventory-management-angular-spring-boot/server/target/_).
Also, it wll create a separate build folder inside the root folder with all the necessary build artifacts and final zip file (_ims-stable-v0.0.1.zip_).
* With the 5th step, It wil run `sudo docker-compose build` and `sudo docker-compose up -d` commands to build and up the containers.
* If you need to install the application with the final build (_ims-stable-v0.0.1.zip_) that has been generated by the "build.sh" script, first you can copy it into anywhere (even in another computer that has docker installed), then extract it, move to the root folder and run the "install.sh" script.

### Installation (on Windows or Mac)

1. Install Docker Desktop (Refer https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/ or https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).
2. Follow the above Ubuntu installation process. With docker, you won't have to do any other OS specific installation steps. Use the docker terminal to run the above commands.
3. If Node.js, npm and Angluar CLI not installed, you may need to install them first before the above Ubuntu installation process.

### Enable Dev Mode

* Dev Mode is defined in several places in the code with "Dev Mode Start" and "Dev Mode End" tags.
  This can be enabled by un-commenting the code lines inside those tags for development purposes.
